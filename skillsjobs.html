    <h2>Skills and Jobs</h2>
    <p>
      While the project has developed from the planning stage, it would still require extensive technical expertise to
      continue the project lifecycle and guarantee continued success in further development and implementation. The
      following are four key positions for people that would be required for the next phase of the project:

      <br><br>1: Full stack software developers

      <br><br>A software developer role would be required to continue to write the code and develop the software according to
      the specifications outlined in the planning stage, along with having the flexibility to make any required changes
      that may be necessary throughout development. The role would require a large amount of expertise in working with
      all aspects of the development life cycle as well as experience with unique requirements for this project, such as
      API integration knowledge for email access and third-party software leveraging. The ability to assist in a variety
      of tasks means that this job role could include assisting in the analysing and understanding of the design
      architecture, writing code and collaborating with other team members to apply solutions to complex tasks and being
      able to integrate successfully within the project team and have the experience to identify and solve problems at
      any moment.

      <br><br>- Relevant Skills/Experience:

      <br><br>- Familiarity with front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript

      <br><br>- Experience with server side languages such as Python and Java

      <br><br>- Effective communication and collaboration skills within a team environment

      <br><br>- Ability to work independently and meet project deadlines

      <br><br>Responsibilities:

      <br><br>- Collaborate with teams to understand project requirements and objectives

      <br><br>- Integrate front-end elements with server-side logic to ensure seamless user interactions

      <br><br>- Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented

      <br><br>- Perform unit testing and participate in code reviews to ensure code quality and reliability

      <br><br>- Collaborate in agile development environments

      <br><br>- Contributing to sprint planning and project discussions

      <br><br>2: Cybersecurity expert

      <br><br>Due to the nature of the project and its proximity with identifying and actioning on vulnerabilities within
      computer systems, a cybersecurity expert would be ideally suited for advising the project leadership team on
      current threats and how to properly safeguard against these threats proactively. The cybersecurity expert would be
      deployed to implement the latest in policies and protocols that are required when dealing with sensitive
      information and data access and would bring a deep understanding of networking, programming, and system
      administration, as well as a constant curiosity to keep up with evolving cyber threats and countermeasures. A
      cybersecurity expert would need to possess strong technical skills, a deep understanding of networking,
      programming, and system administration but most importantly champion the integrity that would be required for this
      project to continue successfully.

      <br><br>Key Skills/Experience:

      <br><br>Experience in leadership roles and the ability to coordinate groups effectively

      <br><br>In-depth knowledge of risk assessment methods and technologies

      <br><br>Experience in developing and documenting security architecture and plans

      <br><br>Responsibilities:

      <br><br>Conduct comprehensive risk assessments and formulate effective mitigation strategies.

      <br><br>Maintain up-to-date knowledge on emerging threats and implementing security best practices.

      <br><br>Proactive identification, analysis and remediation of cyber risks

      <br><br>Handling documentation and compliance with relevant laws and regulations.

      <br><br>3: Quality Assurance/Testers:

      <br><br>QA (Quality Assurance) testers are responsible for testing the software thoroughly to identify and report any
      defects or issues. The tester role would need to perform various testing activities, such as functional testing,
      performance testing, security testing, and usability testing. The goal with this job is to ensure the software
      meets the specified requirements and functions correctly before it is released to users and is exceptionally
      important that it complies to security standards and regulations. This role is integral to the quality of all
      aspects of the project from design to usability and the feedback from a tester would allow time to identify,
      prioritise and fix defects, errors or bugs that can potentially cause issues to the reliability and stability of
      the finished product. These fixes can offer further improvements, reduces risk and improves security along with
      assuring that the product is compliant with not only stakeholder requirements and expectations but also delivers
      the best possible product to the user.

      <br><br>Key Skills/Experience:

      <br><br>Ability to prioritise workload

      <br><br>Ability to develop and present communications and justifications.

      <br><br>Responsibilities:

      <br><br>- Develop testing strategies

      <br><br>- Management of test case results and coverage

      <br><br>- Analyse and reports on test activities, results, issues and risks.

      <br><br>Planning, identifying, executing and reporting on the outcomes of acceptance tests.

      <br><br>4: Technical Writer/Documentation Specialist:

      <br><br>The technical writer or documentation specialist is responsible for creating comprehensive and accurate
      documentation for the software product. This documentation includes user manuals, installation guides, API
      documentation, and other technical documents that help users, administrators, and developers understand how to use
      and maintain the software effectively. The technical writer works closely with the development team to gather
      information about the software's features, functionality, and configurations and organizes this information in a
      clear and coherent manner, ensuring that it is easily accessible to the target audience. Due to the possible
      handover of this project occurring at any stage of the development lifecycle, having professionally written
      documentation is crucial for adoption, troubleshooting, and smooth onboarding of new teams or team members. The
      documentation specialist would work on updating and maintaining the documentation throughout the software's
      lifecycle, ensuring that it stays current with any changes or updates made to the software after its initial
      release. This role helps to improve the overall user experience and reduces the need for constant direct support
      from the development team.

      <br><br>Key skills/Experience:

      <br><br>Proficiency with MS office products – Word, Excel, PowerPoint

      <br><br>Ability to write in a clear and concise manner

      <br><br>Effective communication skills with developers, cyber security specialists and end-users



      <br><br>Responsibilities:

      <br><br>Creation and management of new technical documents and manuals

      <br><br>Collaborate with development team to maintain written documentation
