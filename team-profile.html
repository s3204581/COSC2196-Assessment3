        <h3>Hugo Ekert - s3376686</h3>

        <p>I'm based in Melbourne, and I started in IT as a manual software tester and I have gained valuable experience
            working within Scrum teams at various software companies. Primarily focusing on automated software testing,
            I have also ventured into software development, expanding my skills and knowledge. I enjoy the programming
            side of IT, especially in solving problems through automation and exploring new tools and frameworks.
            Outside of work my hobbies are playing Futsal and I like to review movies on Letterboxd.</p>
