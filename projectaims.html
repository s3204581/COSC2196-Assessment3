    <h2>Project Aims</h2>

    The specific aim of this project is to provide users with an application that detects, prevents and mitigates
    phishing attacks so that the user, their data and identity is further protected against this cyber threat. This
    application specifically provides the user with a dashboard to assist in the monitoring of the application and
    visualises the statistical data provided in a real-time environment and act as a hub for phishing related news and
    information. As this dashboard provides the connection to end users to interact and network with other
    functionality, along with the additional use of the dashboard being able to act as a prototype for future
    functionality, it is integral that it be prioritised over other goals. In the event of unsuccessful or incomplete
    elements of the project occurring, the dashboard can still act as a descriptor and presentation piece for the
    potential for future development. Other key goals include:

    <br><br>- A fully functional website to raise awareness and provide a repository for our libraries, APIs and applications

    <br><br>Having an online presence means the ability to highlight the project and its various artefacts to potential users,
    investors and stakeholders. This can also promote further awareness of the teams aim and provides an official area
    for external sources to connect and remain informed of the team and projects status.



    <br><br>- Connecting to email provider APIs to improve implementation

    <br><br>The ability to integrate with a variety of email providers API (Application Programming Interface) can ensure a
    smooth and safe connection to official email clients and reduces the risk of and ineffective product due to
    compatibility issues.

    <br><br>- Integrate open-source anti-phishing libraries

    <br><br>Further research into and involvement with anti-phishing groups such as the APWG (Anti-Phishing Working Group) can
    further bolster the vision and effectiveness of the project, along with providing a global perspective into legal
    frameworks, future research and trends that the project can implement to both give the user the best possible
    experience and to remain competitive in the cybersecurity landscape.

    <br><br>- Realtime updates and responsiveness to both current and future threats

    <br><br>The ability to act on threats instantly can be just as important as its effectiveness and being up to date with the
    latest information and libraries, along with staying informed of current and future solutions and threats means that
    the program can remain relevant.

    <br><br>- Cloud integration so a user can access and monitor from virtually anywhere

    <br><br>Migrating the program to cloud architecture can assist in real-time updates and connectivity so a user can
    potentially access the dashboard and its functionality from any device at any time â€“ with more heavy lifting on the
    server side the user now also has a more lightweight application. Rather than the concept of downloading libraries
    and code, the user experience could change to simply logging into a secure website to access functionality.
