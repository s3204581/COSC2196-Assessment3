    <h2>Team Profile - The Agile Expendables</h2>

    <p>The Agile Expendables is a dynamic team comprising four members: Hugo Ekert, David Martin, Jake Harman and Igor
      Zofrin. As the Agile-Expendables, we embody the principles of agility and
      adaptability. Together, we bring a diverse range of skills, experience, and perspectives to tackle
      challenges and deliver results.</p>

    <h3>Hugo Ekert - s3376686</h3>

    <p>I'm based in Melbourne, and I started in IT as a manual software tester and I have gained valuable experience
      working within Scrum teams at various software companies. Primarily focusing on automated software testing,
      I have also ventured into software development, expanding my skills and knowledge. I enjoy the programming
      side of IT, especially in solving problems through automation and exploring new tools and frameworks.
      Outside of work my hobbies are playing Futsal and I like to review movies on Letterboxd.</p>

    <h4>Career Plans</h4>
    <p>
      My career plan is to work as a DevOps engineer. Having witnessed firsthand the transformative impact of effective
      DevOps practices on organizational productivity and development team empowerment, I am passionate about
      contributing to this field. However, I have also observed that poorly implemented DevOps can create significant
      obstacles, hindering teams from accomplishing their goals. DevOps revolves around a philosophy of creating
      efficient workflows for development teams, requiring expertise in programming for automation and . In comparison
      to other career paths, DevOps shares technical aspects with Application Security (Igor) and Games Development
      (Ben). Particularly with a game developer a DevOps engineer would need to understand the languages and Technolgies
      the developer is using and support the development with pipelines for building and testing the game. Additionally,
      DevOps can be integrated into the Agile Delivery process (Dave). However, it differs significantly from a UX
      Lead's role (Ben) as it primarily focuses on supporting teams rather than directly addressing end-user experience,
      although a UX Lead's involvement may still be part of the overall process.
    </p>

    <h2>David Martin - s3204581</h2>

    <p>Hello everyone, I’m Dave and I am hoping to cross into an IT career from a previous career in operations
      management. Although ideally a project management career I’m very much interested in coding full stack projects
      and deployment through cloud networking systems. I’m also very interested in learning more about quantum
      computing. Originally from Toowoomba and currently hailing from Canberra. My hobbies include playing guitar and
      drums very badly, watching standup comedy, cricket and NRL and enjoy my time off relaxing with friends and family.
      An interesting fact about me is that I am currently training for my very first triathlon which will be a fun
      challenge. </p>

    <h4>Career Plans</h4>
    <p>
      I personally feel that the variety of experiences and motivations that each member of the team brings to the table
      helps with ascertaining strengths and weaknesses and I enjoy helping to integrate this diversity of skillsets into
      our project requirements with Agile methodologies. While I have experience leading teams in an operational
      context, I am finding this project development lifecycle to be a great snapshot of working in an IT environment
      with a team to solve complex problems and brainstorm unique solutions and ideas. I feel that an Agile delivery
      lead requires the experiences from a variety of project elements and phases along with needing the skill to
      communicate with a variety of parties both outside of and within a team. Comparing this role to that of the other
      roles listed by the team I can identify these factors as the major differentiators amongst each ideal job.
      However, I see the ability to work well with others and the necessity to capture ideas and capitalise on the
      varied experiences of others to achieve a goal being the major common element for each person on this team.
    </p>

    <h3>Jake Harman - s3477973</h3>

    <p>My name is Jake and I’m a lifelong Melbournian. In the past I’ve started and stopped higher education, having
      begun both a Bachelor
      of Biomedical Science at La Trobe and a Bachelor of Design with RMIT. I'm employed with the government in a
      customer service role,
      and looking for a career change with a focus on IT. My initial interest in IT started over ten years ago
      when I built my first
      gaming PC, and most of my experience with IT has been through systems troubleshooting while working. Hobbies
      of mine outside gaming
      include playing guitar and recently trying to learn harmonica; much to the chagrin of my neighbours, I'm
      sure.
    </p>

    <h4>Career Plans</h4>
    <p>
      While a UX Lead appears to differ significantly from the other careers in our group, there still remains
      crossover. Production of game development will utilise a lot of similar tenets relating to a user-centric approach
      applied in different ways to achieve different outcomes. Game development and UX both rely on research and testing
      to achieve more data-driven design choices, and to validate design decisions. Conversely, careers in DevOps and
      Platform security have a much greater emphasis on back-end systems and may limited to no similarities to work
      within UX. Agile IT Delivery Leads have commonality with UX Leads with respect to aligning business goals with
      stakeholders, and team management including things like efficiency, effectiveness, mentorship, motivation and
      correct handling of team dynamics.
    </p>

    <h2>Igor Zofrin</h2>

    <p>I live in Sydney and specialize in IT systems operations and security. My focus is application and network
      security and threat detection. Starting as a network administrator, I enjoyed fortune of being exposed to
      enterprise technology, later shifting focus on software development, and then eventually pivoting to
      information security. </p>

      <h4>Career Plans</h4>
    <p>My career plan is to become a Cyber Security Analyst specializing in forensic analysis and incident response.
      Historically, this role type has not been an easily accessible role to step into or progress given the specialized
      skills and knowledge required which are typically provided only via expensive courses and work experience.
      However, as significance of Information security industry grows by the day, online presence of information shared
      by industry professionals is more readily available and new study courses are becoming available to the public, it
      is possible to gain initial understanding and skills for entry level roles.
      I have always had passion for Cyber Security since being introduced to computers as there is always have room to
      grow new skills and understanding in modern technologies and was lucky to be introduced into this entry level
      role.

      In our project, Cyber Security analytical and engineering skills will compliment configuration and continuous
      deployment (Hugo - DevOps) to cooperatively configure secure web platform and maintaining software supply chain
      validation and application security controls for software development (Ben - developer) </p>
