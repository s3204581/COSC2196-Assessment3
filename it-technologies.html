            <h2>Autonomous Vehicles - Jake Harman</h2>

            <p>Autonomous vehicles, also known as self-driving cars and driverless cars, are vehicles that do not
                require
                human input to operate. They operate by sensing their environment using sensors, actuators, and machine
                learning systems to execute software, allowing them to effectively make choices on the road.</p>

            <p>The Society of Automotive Engineers (<a href="https://www.sae.org/">SAE</a>) defines the 'level' of
                driving
                automation. There are 6 levels of driving automation as follows, split into two overarching categories
                with
                3 levels in each.</p>

            <h2>Levels of Driving Automation</h2>

            <h3>Levels 0-2: Human-Monitored Driving Environment</h3>

            <h4>Level 0 - No Automation</h4>
            <p>This is the level of most vehicles on the road. At this level, the human makes all decisions while
                driving.
            </p>

            <p>Also included at this level of automation are systems like Anti-lock Braking Systems (ABS) which assist
                after
                the human driver has made the choice.</p>

            <h4>Level 1 - Driver Assistance</h4>
            <p>This level encompasses systems that assist the driver in specific ways while operating the vehicle, such
                as
                adaptive cruise control.</p>

            <h4>Level 2 - Partial Driving Automation</h4>
            <p>Level 2 is the highest level of automation approved on Australian roads. Examples include vehicles with
                Tesla
                Autopilot and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS).</p>

            <p>Level 2 features include adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, self-parking, blind spot monitoring,
                adaptive headlights, and traffic jam assist. Although the vehicle can perform steering and acceleration
                control, the human driver is still required to be actively aware and can take control at any time.</p>

            <h3>Levels 3-5: Automated System-Monitored Driving Environment</h3>

            <h4>Level 3 - Conditional Automation</h4>
            <p>Level 3 vehicles are only allowed to be driven in certain parts of the world. The vehicle can make
                informed
                decisions but can request the human driver to take control if required.</p>

            <h4>Levels 4 and 5</h4>
            <p>Levels 4 and 5 are not currently publicly available in consumer vehicles. Level 4 technology is being
                used in
                some business capacities, mostly geared towards ridesharing services. Level 5 vehicles will not possess
                a
                steering wheel and represent fully autonomous vehicles.</p>

            <p>It's anticipated that level 5 autonomous vehicles will not be available in the market for at least a
                decade.
            </p>

            <h2>Impact and Considerations</h2>

            <p>Autonomous vehicles have the potential to significantly impact the workforce, particularly in the taxi
                and
                rideshare services sector. The prevalence of autonomous vehicles is gradually becoming the norm, but
                challenges remain in terms of safety, liability, and defining responsibility in accidents involving
                autonomous vehicles.</p>

            <p>In addition to passenger vehicles, autonomous technology is also being implemented in the trucking
                industry.
                While autonomous trucks offer benefits such as cost reduction and addressing driver shortages, adapting
                the
                technology to larger and heavier vehicles poses additional challenges.</p>

            <p>As the technology progresses, there are cost considerations for consumers, with prices for autonomous
                features and vehicles being relatively high. However, the potential benefits include cost savings,
                reduced
                carbon footprint, and increased sustainability.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, the implementation of driverless trucks may result in infrastructure-related job
                opportunities
                and potential roadworks and freeway closures as the technology is gradually adopted.</p>
