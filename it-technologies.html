            <h2>Autonomous Vehicles - Jake Harman</h2>

            <p>Autonomous vehicles, also known as self-driving cars and driverless cars, are vehicles that do not
                require
                human input to operate. They operate by sensing their environment using sensors, actuators, and machine
                learning systems to execute software, allowing them to effectively make choices on the road.</p>

            <p>The Society of Automotive Engineers (<a href="https://www.sae.org/">SAE</a>) defines the 'level' of
                driving
                automation. There are 6 levels of driving automation as follows, split into two overarching categories
                with
                3 levels in each.</p>

            <h2>Levels of Driving Automation</h2>

            <h3>Levels 0-2: Human-Monitored Driving Environment</h3>

            <h4>Level 0 - No Automation</h4>
            <p>This is the level of most vehicles on the road. At this level, the human makes all decisions while
                driving.
            </p>

            <p>Also included at this level of automation are systems like Anti-lock Braking Systems (ABS) which assist
                after
                the human driver has made the choice.</p>

            <h4>Level 1 - Driver Assistance</h4>
            <p>This level encompasses systems that assist the driver in specific ways while operating the vehicle, such
                as
                adaptive cruise control.</p>

            <h4>Level 2 - Partial Driving Automation</h4>
            <p>Level 2 is the highest level of automation approved on Australian roads. Examples include vehicles with
                Tesla
                Autopilot and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS).</p>

            <p>Level 2 features include adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, self-parking, blind spot monitoring,
                adaptive headlights, and traffic jam assist. Although the vehicle can perform steering and acceleration
                control, the human driver is still required to be actively aware and can take control at any time.</p>

            <h3>Levels 3-5: Automated System-Monitored Driving Environment</h3>

            <h4>Level 3 - Conditional Automation</h4>
            <p>Level 3 vehicles are only allowed to be driven in certain parts of the world. The vehicle can make
                informed
                decisions but can request the human driver to take control if required.</p>

            <h4>Levels 4 and 5</h4>
            <p>Levels 4 and 5 are not currently publicly available in consumer vehicles. Level 4 technology is being
                used in
                some business capacities, mostly geared towards ridesharing services. Level 5 vehicles will not possess
                a
                steering wheel and represent fully autonomous vehicles.</p>

            <p>It's anticipated that level 5 autonomous vehicles will not be available in the market for at least a
                decade.
            </p>

            <h2>Impact and Considerations</h2>

            <p>Autonomous vehicles have the potential to significantly impact the workforce, particularly in the taxi
                and
                rideshare services sector. The prevalence of autonomous vehicles is gradually becoming the norm, but
                challenges remain in terms of safety, liability, and defining responsibility in accidents involving
                autonomous vehicles.</p>

            <p>In addition to passenger vehicles, autonomous technology is also being implemented in the trucking
                industry.
                While autonomous trucks offer benefits such as cost reduction and addressing driver shortages, adapting
                the
                technology to larger and heavier vehicles poses additional challenges.</p>

            <p>As the technology progresses, there are cost considerations for consumers, with prices for autonomous
                features and vehicles being relatively high. However, the potential benefits include cost savings,
                reduced
                carbon footprint, and increased sustainability.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, the implementation of driverless trucks may result in infrastructure-related job
                opportunities
                and potential roadworks and freeway closures as the technology is gradually adopted.</p>

          <h2>Machine Learning - Ben Wright</h2>
          <p>
            Machine learning is a broad term that refers to the use of algorithms, such as neural networks and evolutionary
            algorithms, to make predictions from data. Machine learning can be used in many different ways: for example, it can
            be used to predict future behavior (e.g., fraud detection), classify objects or people into categories
            (e.g., spam filtering), or even find patterns in huge amounts of data (e.g., image recognition).

            Machine learning is a subfield of computer science that is concerned with the design and analysis of algorithms that
            can learn from data. Machine learning algorithms are usually applied to solve problems in which there is a large amount
            of unlabeled data, such as image recognition or speech recognition. The most common use cases for machine learning
            include image recognition, speech recognition, text classification, recommendation engines, fraud detection and credit
            scoring. In fact, many companies are using machine learning algorithms in their products today including Google Translate
            and Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant. Machine Learning is also being used by financial institutions like Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)
            for risk-based trading strategies as well as by insurance companies for claims handling processes.

            The goal of machine learning is for an algorithm to be able to predict outcomes based on input features without being explicitly
            programmed. The most common way this happens in practice is via supervised training, where the algorithm receives labeled examples
            (for example, images with labels like “cat”) and learns how to classify new ones using those labels as inputs. In unsupervised
            training, the algorithm doesn’t receive any labeled examples but instead has access to all available unlabeled examples; it then
            tries to make sense out of them by predicting their class label itself (for example, whether they are photos or videos).
            Another type of supervised training involves having multiple algorithms compete against each other; one algorithm will be given
            a set of labeled examples while another gets its own set but also has access to all unlabeled ones so it can try different ways
            at classifying them. This competition helps identify the best performing model(s) for classification tasks in general — not just
            for specific types of data sets — because it allows us to see which models perform better under certain conditions compared with
            others when presented with similar amounts and kinds of data.

            Machine Learning AI has been around since the 1950s, but it’s only in recent years that we’ve seen significant advancements in its
            capabilities. For example, when IBM Watson beat two human champions on Jeopardy! In 2011, or In 2015, when AlphaGo defeated Go
            champion Lee Sedol at the game of Go with an AI system developed by Google DeepMind called AlphaGo Zero. AI is a rapidly growing
            field that has the potential to impact every aspect of our lives in ways we can't even imagine yet. It’s been called
            “the next industrial revolution” by some experts, but it’s also been called “the most dangerous idea in history” by others because
            it could lead to robots taking over the world if they are programmed to do so.

            The success of businesses such as IBM, Amazon, and Microsoft is apparent by the fact that they are beginning to rely on the ability
            of Machine Learning to automate processes and develop solutions for their various needs. With reliable insights and automated
            expertise, there may be no limit to what Machine Learning can help us achieve in the near future.

            AI models such as ChatGPT represent a remarkable advancement in the field of machine learning. Powered by algorithms like neural networks,
            these models can understand and generate human-like text, enabling them to engage in sophisticated conversations and provide valuable insights.
            AI models are trained on vast amounts of data, allowing them to learn patterns, understand context, and generate relevant responses.
            These models have a wide range of applications, from customer support and virtual assistants to content generation and creative writing.
            They have the potential to revolutionize various industries by automating tasks, enhancing decision-making processes, and improving overall efficiency.
            However, as with any powerful technology, the ethical implications and responsible use of AI models are crucial considerations to ensure that they
            are developed and deployed in a manner that benefits society and respects individual privacy and security.

            The potential impact of Machine Learning on both the technological industries and society as a whole is massive as almost every career or job opportunity
            can be optimized by the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence. The people who will be most affected by the use of machine learning and
            artificial intelligence would be people like engineers, transportation workers, health practitioners, administrators and even food service workers.
            One of the biggest industries where Machine Learning will have some of the biggest impacts is the healthcare industry. Using things like
            Artificial Intelligence to analyze and process patients medical data, healthcare professionals and doctors can achieve better and more accurate insights
            and diagnosis’ both much quicker than previously but also much easier than ever before. Some jobs however will not be affected (at least to a degree)
            as most lower paid service workers such as teachers and personal care employees are not the ideal candidates for being replaced by Machine Learning and
            Artificial Intelligence due to things like ease of employment, abundance of candidates and lower standards of hiring.

            Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool in the field of computer science, enabling algorithms to learn from data and make predictions without explicit programming.
            Its applications are wide-ranging, from predicting future behavior and classifying objects to finding patterns in large datasets. Major companies like Google and Amazon
            have integrated machine learning into their products, while industries such as finance and insurance are leveraging its capabilities for risk assessment and claims handling.
            Machine learning's potential impact is significant, with the ability to optimize various careers and job opportunities, including those in engineering, transportation,
            healthcare, administration, and more. While concerns about its implications exist, the advancements in machine learning hold tremendous promise, and with reliable insights
            and automated expertise, the possibilities for future achievements are limitless.
