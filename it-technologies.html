            <h2>Autonomous Vehicles - Jake Harman</h2>

            <p>Autonomous vehicles, also known as self-driving cars and driverless cars, are vehicles that do not
                require
                human input to operate. They operate by sensing their environment using sensors, actuators, and machine
                learning systems to execute software, allowing them to effectively make choices on the road.</p>

            <p>The Society of Automotive Engineers (<a href="https://www.sae.org/">SAE</a>) defines the 'level' of
                driving
                automation. There are 6 levels of driving automation as follows, split into two overarching categories
                with
                3 levels in each.</p>

            <h2>Levels of Driving Automation</h2>

            <h3>Levels 0-2: Human-Monitored Driving Environment</h3>

            <h4>Level 0 - No Automation</h4>
            <p>This is the level of most vehicles on the road. At this level, the human makes all decisions while
                driving.
            </p>

            <p>Also included at this level of automation are systems like Anti-lock Braking Systems (ABS) which assist
                after
                the human driver has made the choice.</p>

            <h4>Level 1 - Driver Assistance</h4>
            <p>This level encompasses systems that assist the driver in specific ways while operating the vehicle, such
                as
                adaptive cruise control.</p>

            <h4>Level 2 - Partial Driving Automation</h4>
            <p>Level 2 is the highest level of automation approved on Australian roads. Examples include vehicles with
                Tesla
                Autopilot and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS).</p>

            <p>Level 2 features include adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, self-parking, blind spot monitoring,
                adaptive headlights, and traffic jam assist. Although the vehicle can perform steering and acceleration
                control, the human driver is still required to be actively aware and can take control at any time.</p>

            <h3>Levels 3-5: Automated System-Monitored Driving Environment</h3>

            <h4>Level 3 - Conditional Automation</h4>
            <p>Level 3 vehicles are only allowed to be driven in certain parts of the world. The vehicle can make
                informed
                decisions but can request the human driver to take control if required.</p>

            <h4>Levels 4 and 5</h4>
            <p>Levels 4 and 5 are not currently publicly available in consumer vehicles. Level 4 technology is being
                used in
                some business capacities, mostly geared towards ridesharing services. Level 5 vehicles will not possess
                a
                steering wheel and represent fully autonomous vehicles.</p>

            <p>It's anticipated that level 5 autonomous vehicles will not be available in the market for at least a
                decade.
            </p>

            <h2>Impact and Considerations</h2>

            <p>Autonomous vehicles have the potential to significantly impact the workforce, particularly in the taxi
                and
                rideshare services sector. The prevalence of autonomous vehicles is gradually becoming the norm, but
                challenges remain in terms of safety, liability, and defining responsibility in accidents involving
                autonomous vehicles.</p>

            <p>In addition to passenger vehicles, autonomous technology is also being implemented in the trucking
                industry.
                While autonomous trucks offer benefits such as cost reduction and addressing driver shortages, adapting
                the
                technology to larger and heavier vehicles poses additional challenges.</p>

            <p>As the technology progresses, there are cost considerations for consumers, with prices for autonomous
                features and vehicles being relatively high. However, the potential benefits include cost savings,
                reduced
                carbon footprint, and increased sustainability.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, the implementation of driverless trucks may result in infrastructure-related job
                opportunities
                and potential roadworks and freeway closures as the technology is gradually adopted.</p>

            <h3>Cybersecurity - Hugo Ekert</h3>
            <p>Cybersecurity is a dynamic field dedicated to safeguarding computer systems, networks, and data from
                unauthorized access, damage, theft, and other malicious activities. Its primary objective is to protect
                sensitive information, including personal data, financial records, intellectual property, and government
                secrets, from a wide range of cyber threats. These threats manifest in various forms, such as hackers,
                malware, viruses, ransomware, phishing attacks, and more. Given the pervasive use of computer systems in
                critical sectors like banking and national security, successful cyber attacks can have severe
                consequences.</p>
            <h3>Current Cybersecurity Technologies</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Firewalls: Network software that acts as a barrier between internal networks and the internet. A
                    firewall has rules about the type of traffic that can be allowed through and filters out malicious
                    activity assuming it has all the necessary rules. (What is a Firewall? 2023)</li>
                <li>Antivirus Software: Software developed to detect malicious programs on a computer and remove or
                    quarantine them.</li>
                <li>Encryption: Mathematical algorithms that are used to distort data into an unreadable state that can
                    only be read using a mathematical 'key'. Encryption is used for the safe storage of data so that
                    even if the data is stolen, it cannot be read and used by the attacker. (What is encryption and how
                    does it work? | Google Cloud)</li>
                <li>Secure Sockets Layer and Transport Layer Security: Using encryption methodology, SSL/TLS is used to
                    allow secure communication over the internet so that only the sender and receiver of packets can
                    read their messages. If SSL traffic is intercepted by an attacker, they will not be able to decipher
                    it.</li>
                <li>Multi-Factor Authentication: Instead of just relying on a password for authentication, MFA requires
                    another form of verification before allowing access. A common method of MFA is for a user to
                    register a mobile phone number and be sent a code via SMS to verify. It is assumed that it is less
                    likely for an attacker to have both the user's password and access to their mobile phone. (What is
                    multi-factor authentication (MFA)?)</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Emerging Capabilities in Cybersecurity</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Artificial Intelligence: Artificial intelligence (AI) has become increasingly relevant and impactful
                    across multiple industries, including cybersecurity. AI has the potential to revolutionize defense
                    strategies by providing advanced capabilities in detecting cyber threats and analyzing network
                    vulnerabilities. (Ravichandran, 2023)</li>
                <li>Quantum Computing: Quantum computing has the potential to easily crack currently widely used
                    encryption algorithms as the efficiency of processing with q-bits is much faster than regular bits.
                    New algorithms will need to be developed that have a large enough key-space that even quantum
                    computing will not be able to easily crack it. (Arel, Explore the impact of quantum computing on
                    cryptography 2023)</li>
                <li>Internet of Things (IoT) Security: As more things (fridges, televisions, Amazon Alexa, Google Nest)
                    are embedded with devices that allow internet connectivity, the 'attack surface' for cyber attackers
                    becomes greater. Standards will need to be developed for authentication and encryption of IoT
                    devices. (Building Trust in IoT devices with powerful IoT security solutions)</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Impact of Cybersecurity</h4>
            <p>Cybersecurity is a field that has wide-ranging effects, impacting everyone from everyday consumers to
                nation-states. For individuals, the likely impact includes increased security awareness and a greater
                need for personal cybersecurity measures. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) will become more prevalent,
                if not ubiquitous, as an additional layer of protection. Biometric forms of authentication, such as face
                ID, will also become more common and may be adopted by legacy institutions like banking.</p>
            <p>As the collection and storage of personal data continue to increase, individuals may demand stronger
                action from governments to address data security concerns, particularly from companies that collect user
                data. This could lead to the implementation of stricter regulations aimed at ensuring a minimum
                cybersecurity standard for networks across various industries. Consequently, there will be a growing
                demand for cybersecurity professionals, not just in IT companies but across government and other
                sectors. This increased demand will contribute to the growth of the cybersecurity workforce. (Smith,
                2022)</p>
            <p>Furthermore, companies will face cybersecurity regulations and compliance requirements, necessitating
                robust security measures to protect their networks and sensitive data. Failure to comply with these
                regulations may result in financial penalties, reputational damage, and legal consequences.
                Consequently, organizations will need to invest in cybersecurity measures and employ skilled
                professionals to maintain a strong defense against cyber threats. (Medibank class action launched after
                massive hack put private information of millions on dark web 2023) (Information security manual (ISM))
            </p>
            <p>Cybersecurity will increasingly emerge as a critical national security concern for nation-states. The
                protection of critical infrastructure will become imperative as state-sponsored hacking groups, backed
                by nations, target these assets. An example of this was seen in 2021 when a ransomware attack
                compromised a gas pipeline in the United States. (The attack on Colonial Pipeline 2023)</p>
            <p>In the realm of international relations and geopolitics, cybersecurity has become an integral component.
                Nations now engage in cyber espionage, cyber warfare, and cyber influence operations to gain strategic
                advantages or disrupt adversaries. Advanced cybersecurity technologies can significantly enhance a
                nation's defensive capabilities, empowering it to safeguard its interests. (What is Stuxnet?)</p>
            <p>Additionally, governments may establish initiatives to enhance cybersecurity education and training,
                promoting the development of a skilled cybersecurity workforce. (Online, 2023)</p>

            <h2>Machine Learning - Ben Wright</h2>
            <p>
                Machine learning is a broad term that refers to the use of algorithms, such as neural networks and
                evolutionary
                algorithms, to make predictions from data. Machine learning can be used in many different ways: for
                example, it can
                be used to predict future behavior (e.g., fraud detection), classify objects or people into categories
                (e.g., spam filtering), or even find patterns in huge amounts of data (e.g., image recognition).
            </p>
            <p>
                Machine learning is a subfield of computer science that is concerned with the design and analysis of
                algorithms that
                can learn from data. Machine learning algorithms are usually applied to solve problems in which there is
                a large amount
                of unlabeled data, such as image recognition or speech recognition. The most common use cases for
                machine learning
                include image recognition, speech recognition, text classification, recommendation engines, fraud
                detection and credit
                scoring. In fact, many companies are using machine learning algorithms in their products today including
                Google Translate
                and Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant. Machine Learning is also being used by financial institutions like
                Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)
                for risk-based trading strategies as well as by insurance companies for claims handling processes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal of machine learning is for an algorithm to be able to predict outcomes based on input features
                without being explicitly
                programmed. The most common way this happens in practice is via supervised training, where the algorithm
                receives labeled examples
                (for example, images with labels like “cat”) and learns how to classify new ones using those labels as
                inputs. In unsupervised
                training, the algorithm doesn’t receive any labeled examples but instead has access to all available
                unlabeled examples; it then
                tries to make sense out of them by predicting their class label itself (for example, whether they are
                photos or videos).
                Another type of supervised training involves having multiple algorithms compete against each other; one
                algorithm will be given
                a set of labeled examples while another gets its own set but also has access to all unlabeled ones so it
                can try different ways
                at classifying them. This competition helps identify the best performing model(s) for classification
                tasks in general — not just
                for specific types of data sets — because it allows us to see which models perform better under certain
                conditions compared with
                others when presented with similar amounts and kinds of data.
            </p>
            <p>
                Machine Learning AI has been around since the 1950s, but it’s only in recent years that we’ve seen
                significant advancements in its
                capabilities. For example, when IBM Watson beat two human champions on Jeopardy! In 2011, or In 2015,
                when AlphaGo defeated Go
                champion Lee Sedol at the game of Go with an AI system developed by Google DeepMind called AlphaGo Zero.
                AI is a rapidly growing
                field that has the potential to impact every aspect of our lives in ways we can't even imagine yet. It’s
                been called
                “the next industrial revolution” by some experts, but it’s also been called “the most dangerous idea in
                history” by others because
                it could lead to robots taking over the world if they are programmed to do so.
            </p>
            <p>
                The success of businesses such as IBM, Amazon, and Microsoft is apparent by the fact that they are
                beginning to rely on the ability
                of Machine Learning to automate processes and develop solutions for their various needs. With reliable
                insights and automated
                expertise, there may be no limit to what Machine Learning can help us achieve in the near future.
            </p>
            <p>
                AI models such as ChatGPT represent a remarkable advancement in the field of machine learning. Powered
                by algorithms like neural networks,
                these models can understand and generate human-like text, enabling them to engage in sophisticated
                conversations and provide valuable insights.
                AI models are trained on vast amounts of data, allowing them to learn patterns, understand context, and
                generate relevant responses.
                These models have a wide range of applications, from customer support and virtual assistants to content
                generation and creative writing.
                They have the potential to revolutionize various industries by automating tasks, enhancing
                decision-making processes, and improving overall efficiency.
                However, as with any powerful technology, the ethical implications and responsible use of AI models are
                crucial considerations to ensure that they
                are developed and deployed in a manner that benefits society and respects individual privacy and
                security.
            </p>
            <p>
                The potential impact of Machine Learning on both the technological industries and society as a whole is
                massive as almost every career or job opportunity
                can be optimized by the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence. The people who will be most
                affected by the use of machine learning and
                artificial intelligence would be people like engineers, transportation workers, health practitioners,
                administrators and even food service workers.
                One of the biggest industries where Machine Learning will have some of the biggest impacts is the
                healthcare industry. Using things like
                Artificial Intelligence to analyze and process patients medical data, healthcare professionals and
                doctors can achieve better and more accurate insights
                and diagnosis’ both much quicker than previously but also much easier than ever before. Some jobs
                however will not be affected (at least to a degree)
                as most lower paid service workers such as teachers and personal care employees are not the ideal
                candidates for being replaced by Machine Learning and
                Artificial Intelligence due to things like ease of employment, abundance of candidates and lower
                standards of hiring.
            </p>
            <p>
                Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool in the field of computer science, enabling algorithms to
                learn from data and make predictions without explicit programming.
                Its applications are wide-ranging, from predicting future behavior and classifying objects to finding
                patterns in large datasets. Major companies like Google and Amazon
                have integrated machine learning into their products, while industries such as finance and insurance are
                leveraging its capabilities for risk assessment and claims handling.
                Machine learning's potential impact is significant, with the ability to optimize various careers and job
                opportunities, including those in engineering, transportation,
                healthcare, administration, and more. While concerns about its implications exist, the advancements in
                machine learning hold tremendous promise, and with reliable insights
                and automated expertise, the possibilities for future achievements are limitless.

            <h2>Clouds, Services, Servers - Dave Martin</h2>
            <p>What does it do?</p>

            <p>Cloud computing is the delivery of computing resources and services over the internet. Rather than
                storing and processing data on local computers or servers, cloud computing is the networking of remote
                servers hosted on the internet to handle various tasks and provide access to resources. Cloud services
                include storage, databases, software applications, and networking. These services can be scaled up or
                down based on the needs of the user and traffic load, allowing for flexibility and cost efficiency.
                Users can access these cloud resources and services from an internet connection using a variety of smart
                devices such as computers or smartphones and from any location. The infrastructure of cloud computing
                consists of data centres that contain multiple servers and networking hardware. These data centres are
                managed by cloud service providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), who handle the maintenance,
                security, and availability of the infrastructure. Cloud computing offers a host of deployment models,
                such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service
                (SaaS), allowing users to choose the level of control and management they require and highlights the
                elasticity and flexibility of this technology.</p>

            <p>The future of cloud computing is likely to see continued growth and innovation with advancements in
                technology, evolving business needs and a constantly evolving digital economy. Organisations are
                increasingly adopting hybrid and multi-cloud strategies, leveraging a combination of public and private
                clouds to meet their specific requirements. This trend is likely to continue as businesses seek to
                optimise costs, improve performance, and enhance data security. As the Internet of Things (IoT)
                continues to expand, there will be a growing need to process data closer to the edge of the network and
                Edge computing enables faster response times, reduced latency, and more efficient bandwidth utilisation
                that cloud providers will require to provide support for.</p>

            <p>Serverless computing, also known as Function as a Service (FaaS), is another innovative technology which
                allows developers to focus on writing code without worrying about underlying infrastructure management.
                It abstracts away the traditional server and infrastructure aspects, allowing for efficient scaling and
                cost optimisation. Serverless architectures are expected to become more prevalent as organisations seek
                greater agility and cost-effectiveness in the future. Cloud platforms are already offering machine
                learning services, enabling developers to leverage pre-built models and APIs for tasks such as natural
                language processing, image recognition, and data analysis. In the future, cloud providers are likely to
                enhance these capabilities further, making it easier for businesses to adopt machine learning
                technologies without requiring extensive expertise.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionise various industries by solving complex problems that
                are beyond the reach of classical computers. While still in its initial stages, cloud providers are
                investing in quantum computing research and development. In the future, we may see cloud-based quantum
                computing services becoming available, allowing organisations to access the power of quantum computing
                without the need for significant infrastructure investments.</p>

            <p>Security and data privacy concerns have always been important considerations in cloud computing as
                threats to cloud systems highlight the negative implications to having limited access to physical
                hardware and the reliance of third parties monitoring and being responsible for a business's data. In
                the future, cloud providers will need to stay relevant and competitive by continuing to enhance their
                security measures such as advanced encryption, authentication mechanisms, and compliance certifications
                to address evolving threats that will also increase in quantity and quality in the future.</p>

            <p>What is the likely impact?</p>

            <p>The biggest impact this development will have will be the effects on the global economy as cloud
                computing requires constant improvements and efficiencies to networking and hardware infrastructure
                which means a major focus on information technology research and development. This drive for progress
                increases needs for consumption of resources, a skilled workforce, and a drive to create a product that
                is desirable to a growing consumer base to further economic growth.</p>

            <p>With the increasing demand for computing resources, there is a growing focus on reducing the
                environmental impact of data centres and cloud infrastructure. This comes primarily through the energy
                required to power the data centres 80% of which is derived from fossil fuels and can have a disastrous
                impact to the environment. Cloud providers are exploring alternative ways to optimise energy usage,
                increase resource efficiency, and embrace renewable energy sources to create greener cloud computing
                environments and reduce their footprint.</p>

            <p>Cloud computing has altered the job landscape by providing new roles and altering existing roles. It is
                important for workers to skill up and remain relevant by adapting to cloud architecture particularly as
                organisations look to shift from the traditional on-site data centre to a cloud infrastructure which can
                impact the data technician employee. There can be redundancies in the job of a traditional data centre
                technician or systems administrator as the requirement for manual, localised software and hardware
                upgrades and maintenance becomes less relevant with the shift to cloud-based infrastructure. The
                additional opportunities with cloud architecture however sees more requirement for specialised roles in
                cloud platform maintenance and support with additional opportunity to work remotely due to the anywhere,
                anytime nature of the cloud. In theory it is possible for technicians and administrators to learn and
                gain certifications in these new roles while still holding relevance to their previous work history.</p>

            <p>How will this affect you?</p>

            <p>This technology lowers the barrier of entry to any consumer by providing scalable solutions that can
                affect people that would typically be unable to access similar architecture and software development due
                to hardware costs and resource limitations. This is shown in the emergence of startup companies and
                individuals who can now bring innovation and ideas with how easy it is to build, test and deploy
                applications. The scalability of cloud computing provides a flexibility for users that can adapt to
                their requirements immediately and provides a fast and effortless way to store and backup data that
                eliminates the requirement of individual hardware, meaning that cloud services can cater to a wide
                variety of use cases. It also eliminates factors such as faulty equipment or theft which would have
                stopped users in the past and offers the added benefit of accessing personal data from multiple devices
                – an ability that could only be done by physical transfer previously. This access grants people the
                opportunity to be able to work together in real time on platforms such as MS Teams where collaboration
                and communication with online documents can be done collectively. This streamlines a lot of work and
                education applications as people can work remotely – a factor that has streamlined productivity and
                communications.</p>

            <p>The affect that cloud technology has to a person in their everyday life such as a family member or
                friend is uniquely tied to its accessibility, convenience, and flexibility. The need for cloud
                architecture can vary drastically depending on the individual use case but the ability for the
                technology to scale to that use case requirement and provide a solution that caters to the individual
                highlights the power in scalability and ease of use. The affect can vary but the most common use case is
                data storage and backup – an efficient solution that highlights the importance of information technology
                and how it networks people together.</p>
