        <h2>Project Idea</h2>
		<p>Email phishing attacks (baiting an unsuspecting computer user and hoping that they will bite) are some of the most frequent and dangerous online threats that target individuals and businesses these days.</p>
		<p>Often being social engineering attacks, phishing emails can be cleverly crafted to appear completely benign technically to both user and antimalware scanner but tricking an email recipient into cliking on 
		malicious site that looks legitimate or download a document that hides malware.<br>
		Combating ongoing and ever evolving phishing email threats typically requires a team of cyber security analysists, end user education, expensive email scanner platforms and malware sandboxes.
		</p>
		<p>Our team #insert team name# believes we can help small businesses and individuals fight against fraud and phishing emails avoiding costly enterprise solutions, enriching community threat intelligence as well as being an open system providing and consuming external system APIs.</p>
