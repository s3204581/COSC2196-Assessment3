    <h2>Team Reflection</h2>

    <p>As we conclude our project journey, we reflected on the experiences, challenges, and achievements that have
      shaped our collective efforts. Our project, PhishNet, has been a project of collaboration and dedication. This
      reflection encapsulates the lessons we've learned and the growth we've experienced as a group. Our group comprised
      individuals from varied backgrounds, each bringing unique perspectives and skill sets to the table. This
      diversity, while initially presenting challenges in communication and understanding, ultimately led to the
      creation of innovative and well-rounded solutions. We learned that embracing diverse viewpoints fosters creativity
      and widens our horizons. By pooling our skills, insights, and efforts, we achieved outcomes that far exceeded what
      any individual could have accomplished alone. The synergy of our collective work brought depth and breadth to our
      project, resulting in an outcome that we are proud to present.

      In conclusion, our project journey has been one of growth, learning, and accomplishment. We acknowledge the
      challenges we faced and the lessons we've learned as invaluable components of our experience. As we move forward
      individually and collectively, we carry with us the knowledge that effective collaboration, communication, and a
      resilient mindset are keys to success. Our achievements stand as a testament to our dedication and determination
      as a group.</p>

    <h2>Dave's reflection</h2>

    <p>We worked better as a group for this assignment. We tried to implement an agile sprint system using the Trello
      board and this helped us even if the sprints blurred into one at the end. The board was useful in a lot of
      respects it helped me see the full scope of what we needed to do. And it helped me stay motivated to keep working
      on tasks. It was also useful to see what other people were working on. We also met more frequently and
      communicated better. Our collaboration on specific tasks could still use some improvement. For example, I did a
      lot of work on the prototype and in retrospect I wish I could have collaborated with other members of the group
      more on it.

      Even though we had the board our time management still could use some work. We anticipated that we would have a
      lot to do in the last few days, but I wish I worked harder earlier so the end was not so stressful.

      The idea was a fun idea. I enjoyed researching cyber security and looking into what the cyber security market is
      like. It has inspired me to keep researching cyber security, I might try to work on some of my own cyber security
      projects in the future.</p>
