        <h2>Team Reflection</h2>

        <p>Initially it took a while for all the team members to connect with each other using teams. However eventually we did all connect found the everyone was very motivated to performing well in the team and helping each other. Once we all connected, we were able to identify each team member's unique skills and assign relevant tasks accordingly. This approach ensured a balanced distribution of work among the group. Additionally, we demonstrated good communication, scheduling regular meetings, and maintaining a shared understanding of the assignment. Our friendly and cooperative interactions contributed to a positive group dynamic. 

However, there are areas that we can improve for future projects. One aspect that requires attention is time management. We should allocate more time for reviewing each other's work and testing the final product to ensure a more thorough and polished outcome. Additionally, we might consider setting aside dedicated time for integrating all our individual contributions, ensuring a cohesive result. Another area for improvement could be the selection of a project manager to oversee our progress, coordinate efforts, and keep the project on track.  

One surprising aspect of our group project was how easily we divided the workload among ourselves. Despite some team members' past challenges with group work, we quickly and efficiently allocated tasks without any difficulties. This surprising ease of division allowed the project to progress smoothly and showcased our ability to collaborate effectively. 

Through this group project we learned some things about the nature of a group, in particular the significance of regular communication. The successful outcome of our project was attributed to our open and consistent communication. It facilitated the sharing of ideas, ensured a shared understanding of the tasks at hand. Also, we recognized the importance of tracking decisions and setting clear agendas to maintain focus and organization within our group. </p>

        <h2>Dave's reflection</h2>

        <p>I think the assignment was feasible for a collective of 5 people to achieve easily and I felt like the technical skills required such as knowledge of coding and GitHub were not as important as learning about team development and how to interact with others to achieve a common goal. I think that initial contact for some was difficult and some extra planning and time management – such as allocating time for testing the final website – would have been a benefit to the final product. The one surprising thing I learnt about working with a team was the diverse backgrounds everyone had which meant that there was a variety of skills and knowledge to tap into and with everyone engaged and motivated It was enjoyable to learn more about everyone and listen to ideas that come from different perspectives to my own. I feel like that was my major take away about working with groups: everyone can contribute in their own unique way which can bring about some very innovative ideas and it was important to make sure we all shared our experiences and mapped out the work so that we boosted everyone’s strengths and covered our weaknesses. </p>

        <h2>Jake's reflection</h2>

        <p>I think the group did very well with the division of labour. Once we had the foundations of what work needed to be done, splitting the workload between people was very smooth. Our meetings were also very succinct, and the group members were active in expressing strengths and interests, again contributing to dividing work evenly. 

An area for improvement would be getting work done earlier and having better communication when the group was made. Overall, we had somewhat of a rough start getting everyone together. 

Something that I found surprising was how autonomous we were able to be. Our group didn’t have a truly dedicated leader; everyone was able to come to an agreement on what needed to be done throughout the meetings and work was completed without any need for checking in on others. 

What I’ve learned about groups is how effective online communication can be with people you have never met before. I’ve been a part of many groups working remotely as part of the workplace, but always with people I’ve either met in person, or at the very least worked with before in some capacity.  I’ve definitely come to learn the true value of communication tools like MS teams in this regard. </p>

        <h2>Ben's reflection</h2>

        <p>I think the group did very well with identifying each member's unique skills and abilities, effectively assigning relevant workloads to ensure a balanced distribution of tasks. Because of this, the assessment was broken up into different parts for each member to work on allowing the assessment to be done quickly and effectively. One thing I think could be worked on would be trying to better manage our time with the assessment so as to avoid having to rush before the deadline. One thing that surprised me was how easy it was to split the workload out between each member. This surprised me because when I have worked in teams before it has been slow and disorganized, but our team quickly and easily worked it out. One thing I have learned about groups would be that regular communication makes everything a lot easier. </p>

        <h2>Hugo's reflection</h2>

        <p>The group worked well once we all connected, everyone was friendly and easy to get on with. We all communicated well, and we all had a similar understanding of the assignment. We were good at scheduling meetings and understanding and dividing the work up evenly. Some people were really fast at writing their sections. Things that could be improved next time would be allocating more time for reviewing each other's work and testing the website. We all did a lot of work but I think we forgot to allocate enough time to combining all the work together. Also, I think it might have been beneficial to ‘elect’ someone as the project manager. I was surprised about how easy it was to divide the work and how keen everyone was to help and take on tasks. One thing I learned about groups is the importance of tracking decisions and setting agendas.  </p>
