        <h2>Employer Demand</h2>
        <p>We have ranked these ideal jobs, utilizing data from various sources, including the Australian Government
            website's Labour Insight Occupation Profile search, the 2021 Skills Priority List, and input from IT
            recruiters. Although the exact same job titles may not have been listed in our data sources, we were able to
            identify equivalent positions to determine the employer demand ranking for each job.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Application and Platform Security</strong> - According to the Labour Market Insight, there are
                currently 63,600 employed individuals in the field of Database & Systems Administrators & ICT Security
                in Australia, with a growth rate of 38.9%. This field is currently experiencing significant government
                investment. (Database & Systems Administrators & ICT Security)
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Agile IT Delivery Lead</strong> - There are no direct equivalents for Agile IT Delivery Lead in
                Labour Market Insights. The closest match is ICT project Manager, which indicates 37,800 individuals
                employed but does not provide information on future growth. The fact that there are 37,800 employed in
                this field suggests it is a significant one. Clicks IT Recruitment ranks ICT Project Manager as their
                5th highest in-demand IT job. (ICT project managers)
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>UX Lead</strong> - The title "UX Lead" refers to a specific role. The closest equivalent in
                Labour Market Insights would likely be Graphic and Web Designers, and Illustrators. This field employs a
                significant number of individuals, with 51,700 employed and a projected growth rate of 21.7%.
                Additionally, the Skills Priority List highlights a strong demand for the field of 232414 Web Designer,
                which is closely related to the responsibilities of a UX Lead.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>DevOps Engineer</strong> - DevOps is a relatively new field that combines specific technology
                skills to support software delivery. In labor job markets, it would fall under the umbrella of Software
                and Application Programmers, employing 177,700 people with a growth rate of 27%. Although this category
                encompasses various fields, DevOps is a part of this overall growth. The Skills Priority List also
                indicates strong demand for fields such as 263212 ICT Support Engineer, which may include aspects of
                DevOps.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Game Developer</strong> - Labour Market Insights indicates that there are currently 650 Game and
                Multimedia Developers employed in Australia, with no available prediction for future growth. This number
                is relatively small for the IT industry, suggesting that game development is a niche field in Australia.
                However, the skills required for a Game Developer are generally analogous to those of a Software
                Engineer, which Labour Insights reports to have 30,600 employed individuals in Australia. While Labour
                Market Insights does not provide a growth prediction specifically for Software Engineering, the Skills
                Priority List does indicate a strong demand for this field.

        <h2>Comparing the Burning Glass Data</h2>
        <p>We can observe a strong demand from employers for programming skills such as JavaScript, Python, SQL, and C#.
            Knowledge of operating systems like Windows and Linux is also in demand. It's worth noting that skills
            related to cloud and automation might not show high demand in the Burning Glass Data, but this could be due
            to the data only extending until March 21, 2018.</p>
        <p>When examining the general skills, we can see that all the listed skills are in demand according to the
            Burning Glass data. Communication holds the highest value and is crucial for all the ideal jobs, especially
            when collaborating with diverse stakeholders in teams.</p>
        <p>However, there are a few IT skills that our group might be missing based on the Burning Glass data:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>SAP: Knowledge of this large enterprise software system may not be relevant to our chosen jobs.</li>
            <li>Business Management: The selected jobs are not business-focused and may not require skills in
                determining business requirements or managing business areas.</li>
            <li>Building Relationships: While our ideal jobs require teamwork, they may not encompass the specific
                skills of building relationships with customers and partners like other roles do.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Regarding general skills, the top three skills that our group may be missing, as suggested by the Burning
            Glass data, are as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Writing: While our selected ideal jobs may involve some documentation, they may not require high-level
                report writing or technical documentation skills.</li>
            <li>Troubleshooting: Although all jobs require troubleshooting to some extent, our roles may not
                specifically demand the troubleshooting skills required of a network engineer, for example.</li>
            <li>Research: Our selected roles will involve some research, but not to the extent required of a data
                scientist or software engineer.</li>
        </ol>
        <p> After examining the Burning Glass data, our opinions regarding our Ideal Jobs remain unchanged. We firmly
            believe that these jobs encompass desirable skills that have likely experienced growth or maintained their
            demand since the publication of the Burning Glass data.</p>
