        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <h2>Topic</h2>
        <p>Our project aims to provide an open-source cybersecurity tool for users to help protect themselves from
            phishing email attacks and other email fraud. Phishing is a method that cyber criminals use to trick people
            into giving out their personal information or convincing the user to click on malicious links or attachments
            to install malware. Email is an extremely popular attack vector for cybercriminals as it is a direct way to
            attack individuals at extremely low expense. Emails cost nothing to send and addresses can easily be scraped
            from the internet or even guessed/generated allowing for huge volumes to be sent. Also, the impersonal
            nature of email makes it difficult for users to determine if an email is from a legitimate source. </p>
        <p>
            With our project we aim to provide a tool for all people to educate and protect themselves against cyber
            criminals. Australians are a very tempting target for cybercriminals as we are a wealthy country. According
            to the ACCC (Australian Competition and Consumer Commission) in 2022 Australians lost <a
                href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-04-17/australian-money-losses-to-scams-tops-3b-accc-report-says/102223720">billion
                to frauds</a> broken down as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Investment scams: $1.5b</li>
            <li>Remote access: $229.2m</li>
            <li>Payment redirection: $224.9m</li>
            <li>Romance scams: $210.2m</li>
            <li>Phishing: $157.6m</li>
            <li>Other: $784m</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The ACCC measured phishing as losing Australians $157.6 million in 2022 but the true figure is higher as not
            all victims would have reported their losses. Email also used for the other types of scams such as romance
            and investment scams as an email provides direct access to a potential victim. </p>
        <p>Large companies have long appreciated the vulnerability of email. A company of 10000 employees will have
            10000 email address. All a cybercriminal need do is trick one of these people via email into clicking a
            malicious link to potentially cause a data breach which can easily cost a company <a
                href="https://hbr.org/2023/05/the-devastating-business-impacts-of-a-cyber-breach">millions of
                dollars</a>. To
            combat phishing attacks from cybercriminals companies will employ cyber security specialists and using
            technology to scan emails and blocking specific addresses. Large companies will also constantly provide
            training and reminders to their staff about suspicious emails.</p>
        <p>However small business and individuals they do not have access to these resources. Most Australians would be
            aware of phishing but will not have the same protection for employees of large companies with value to
            protect. Our project will provide an open-source solution for induvial and small business to educate and
            protect themselves against phishing attacks. Just as Dropbox enables users to effortlessly store files in
            the cloud through a simple drag-and-drop process, we aim to offer our users a comparable experience,
            allowing them to scan potentially malicious emails with equal ease.</p>
        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>
            As shown above cybercrime is a growing threat to all people as cybercriminals can use <a
                href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/06/23/ai-and-cybercrime-unleash-a-new-era-of-menacing-threats/?sh=5139c0f162b2">automated
                methods</a> to
            generate more convincing emails and cast their net wider. Our projects align with the IT trend of increased
            awareness of the necessity for everyone to protect themselves against cybercriminals. To any future employer
            our project would show our knowledge of the cyber security landscape and experience in protecting users from
            cyber threats. Cybersecurity is a <a
                href="https://www.dataprise.com/resources/blog/2023-cybersecurity-spending/">growing area of
                expenditure</a> and potential employers would values employees
            with practical experience in the cyber security domain.
        </p>
        <h2>Landscape</h2>
        <p>
            Most email clients have some phishing detection built in. <a
                href="https://safety.google/intl/en_au/gmail/">Gmail</a> <a
                href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/anti-phishing-protection-about?view=o365-worldwide">Outlook</a>
            have anti phishing features,
            however these often need to be configured by administrators to completely filter potential phishing emails.
            Also given their widespread usage of Gmail and Outlook cybercriminals put considerable effort into bypassing
            their filters. Anti-phishing security tools can work and various levels and interfaces of systems. <a
                href="https://layerxsecurity.com/">LayerX</a> is
            an enterprise security solution that works at the browser layers monitoring the activity on browsers.
            <a href="https://www.barracuda.com/products/email-protection/phishing-protection">Barracuda</a> and <a
                href="https://www.memcyco.com/home">Memcyco</a> are enterprise solutions that work at the infrastructure
            level analysing emails that
            are potentially malicious. These solutions need to be installed and managed by professional security teams.
            Our project different from the landscape of anti-phishing tools in that it is not an enterprise tool or a
            browser extension that monitors the browser activity. Also, our project does not filter phishing emails from
            the user inbox. Our tool is open source and therefore can be used by anyone. It will provide users with
            analysis and education for their protection after they have received an email that could potentially be a
            phishing email.
